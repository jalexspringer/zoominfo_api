Philanthropist and A Really Cool Guy\n\nElon Musk moved to Canada at the age of 18 and a year later started his college life when got accepted into Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.\nHe quickly (after just two years) left his college and got transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned two degrees; a Bachelor of Science in physics, and in economics.\nIn 1994, he moved to California and had a short time spent at applied physics Ph.D. studies at Stanford University (he left after just two days, to chase his entrepreneurial dreams).\n\nBeginnings of an Aspiring Career\n\nHis first company was called Zip2, it was a startup that provided online publishing services for media and newspaper companies.\nHe basically created the first online Yellow Pages, a pretty astonishing feat to achieve in the year 1996.\nMusk wanted to become the CEO of Zip2 but was denied by the board of directors.\nEventually, Zip2 was sold to Compaq for whooping $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options.\nMusk got 7% of that money ($22 million).\n\nBefore eBay bought PayPal, Musk already founded SpaceX, a company that will ultimately prove that private-owned space transport companies can actually be profitable.\n\nSpaceX, Tesla Motors, And A Few Other Projects\n\nSpaceX fairing\n\nMusk moved to LA, in order to be closer to the space industry, since NASA's famous JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) was located there.\nHis dreams demanded to be fulfilled, and one of them was sending rockets into space.\nHe traveled to Russia with a single goal of buying a rocket that he could send on space missions, like bringing the needed provisions to ISS (International Space Station).\nBut the realization that rockets are actually too expensive and that he could actually build a space-faring rocket for just a fraction of the cost he would pay for already-built one.\n\nMusk wanted to jump-start electric vehicle industry by making radical changes and developing new technologies.\n\nAll of Tesla Motors patents are free for use by anyone; Musk explained that this decision could lead to much faster progress of the electric cars industry.\n\nOther notable projects of Elon Musk include Hyperloop, a high-speed low-cost transportation system, which should soon enter into the testing phase, OpenAI, artificial intelligence Research Company, and SolarCity, a solar-powered systems manufacturer, and provider.\n"},{"Url":"http:\/\/www.hlcs-md.com\/2015\/08\/24\/how-tesla-energy-will-change-how-your-business-uses-power\/","Description":"Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, is at it again with something more than just cars.\nIn fact, he's been busy cooking up something that may revolutionize the way businesses and homes use power, and it's called the Powerball (and, for businesses, it's called the Powerpack).\n\nHowever, the Powerpack is something that Musk calls \"infinitely scalable,\" and can be used to power even large factory-type businesses for hours, days, or longer depending on how many units have been installed.\n"},{"Url":"http:\/\/www.rightmanagement.ca\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/right-us-en\/home\/thoughtwire\/categories\/career-work\/5-leadership-lessons-from-elon-musk","Description":"\"Elon Musk is an inventor and builder wrapped into one, kind of like a combination of Benjamin Franklin and Steve Jobs, on steroids,\" Randy Ottinger, Executive Vice President at Kotter International, once said.\n\nMusk believes that he can cut the cost of space travel and set out to make it a reality.\nAlong the journey, he faced delays in design and testing, which pushed him a few years behind schedule.\nHis original scheduled launch was a failure because the engine caught fire.\nThe second test did not go as far into orbit as he expected.\nBut he didn't abandon his project, instead he learned lessons from his failures and made corrections along the way, until his Falcon rocket had its first successful launch in June 2010.\nDo you give up too soon on your dreams?\nOperate with integrity: The most effective leaders operate with integrity, taking the high road.\nAlthough Elon Musk invested at least $55 million of his own money when he founded Tesla Motors to produce electric cars, he needed more money, so he borrowed over $400 million from the government.\nHe repaid the loan, thanked the Department of Energy, members of Congress and others who helped to make his dream a reality.\nMake it a habit to take the high road.\nContinuous learning is a priority: Effective leaders like Elon Musk are constantly generating ideas.\nAs a serial entrepreneur, he has created several billion dollar companies based on his ideas, how does he do it?\nMusk is a serious reader, who is able to see the interconnection of two things that others cannot see.\n"},{"Url":"http:\/\/www.berkley-group.com\/news-and-events\/job-interview-questions-of-the-world-s-most-successful-leaders-news-and-events-53343014311","Description":"Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla,

He has already stated he is willing to jump on the first SpaceX mission to Mars and that he hopes to die on Mars.\nCommitment is not an issue.\nIt's a matter of cost and technological capability.\nAnd Musk thinks he has more or less figured it all out.\nHe thinks he can do it.\n\nJust 40 years old and Musk has already built three successful, groundbreaking companies - Paypal, Tesla Motors, and SpaceX.\nWow.
